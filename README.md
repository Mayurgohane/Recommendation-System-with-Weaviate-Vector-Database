# Recommendation-System-with-Weaviate-Vector-Database

This project is a book recommendation service that suggests books based on a user's inputted genre and book titles. It utilizes a database of 7000 books retrieved from Kaggle. By leveraging **Ada v2** as the large language model, vector embeddings are generated to enable quick vector searches for semantically similar books through natural language input.


## Features
- Input genre and book titles to get book recommendations.
- Vector Search using a **Weaviate Vector Database** with a dataset of 7000 books.
- **Jupyter Notebook workflow** to generate and store vector embeddings in Weaviate.
- Integration with **Ollama** or **OpenAI** for vector generation and inference.
